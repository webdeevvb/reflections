When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
While colloborating with multiple developers or working on multiple computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
One might decide to share only some branches from the local repo to remote. On
the other hand we might be interested in pulling only certain branches from
the remote. It is hard to conceive an automated procedure to accomplish this.
