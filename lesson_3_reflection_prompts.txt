When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
While colloborating with multiple developers or working on multiple computers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
One might decide to share only some branches from the local repo to remote. On
the other hand we might be interested in pulling only certain branches from
the remote. It is hard to conceive an automated procedure to accomplish this. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?
Branch is a different line of development in the code. Clone is a copy of a
remote repo, this creates a connection to the remote repo and the local repo.
A fork is a copy of a repo from someone's code directly from github that you
wish to modify or work on but do not have permission directly. Forking also
provides credit to the authors of the original code that you started the work
from.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
This will help us work locally and do the merging locally as for example
working on a plane.
