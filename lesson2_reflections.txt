What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory is created within the repository (or the main directory).
This file will have all the metadata that will be tracked and the details
regarding different commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
An intermediate space that provides the flexibility to add only the changes in
certain files and perform the commit while not committing any already made
changes that are functionally not related.
