A .git directory is created within the repository (or the main directory).

repository? What value do you think it offers?
An intermediate space that provides the flexibility to add only the changes in
certain files and perform the commit while not committing any already made
changes that are functionally not related.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Use git diff and git diff --staged to understand the changes between (working
directory & staging area and staging area & repo recent commit. Then add only
the changes one wants to commit to staging area, make sure this is exactly
what we would like to commit by git diff --staged and then perform the commit
operation

history organized? How would branches help?

on the parallel branch till and at a later point we could bring it to main
stream or retain it as such. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
